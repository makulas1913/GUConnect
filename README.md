### üíªÔ∏è Languages & Libraries Used
- Flutter: is Google's open-source UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, using the Dart programming language.

- Firebase SDK: is a comprehensive platform by Google that offers tools and services for mobile and web app development, including authentication, Firestore (a NoSQL cloud database), cloud functions, and more, simplifying backend infrastructure management.
	- Firestore is Firebase's NoSQL cloud database that provides real-time data synchronization and querying capabilities, allowing developers to structure and manage app data efficiently across various devices.

	- Firebase Authentication (FireAuth): is a secure authentication system within Firebase SDK, enabling easy integration of user authentication methods like email/password, social logins, and phone number authentication into mobile and web applications.

	- Cloud Functions: is a serverless computing service that allows developers to execute backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features or HTTP requests, enabling custom server-side logic without managing servers directly.
 - 
	- Local Notifications: are alerts triggered and displayed directly on a user's device, enhancing user engagement by providing timely updates, reminders, or alerts within the app without requiring a server.
	- Google Maps: is a mapping service that, when integrated into Flutter using google_maps_flutter package, offers interactive maps, markers, routing, and geolocation services, enabling users to explore locations and navigate within mobile applications.

**Usability Dataset Description:**

The usability dataset captures essential user interactions and screen time data within our application, enabling a comprehensive analysis of user behavior and engagement. The dataset includes three main components:

1. **User Information:**
   - **User Email:** This field serves as a unique identifier for users.
   - **User Type:** Specifies the type of user, providing insights into different user categories or roles.

2. **User Events:**
   - **Event Name:** Describes various user interactions, such as button clicks and scrolls.
   - **Timestamp:** Records the exact date and time when the event occurred. This information is crucial for understanding the temporal aspects of user engagement.

3. **Screen Time:**
   - **Screen Name:** Identifies the specific screen or page within the Flutter app.
   - **Start Time:** Marks the beginning of the user's interaction with a particular screen.
   - **End Time:** Indicates when the user navigates away from the screen.
   - **Duration:** Measures the time spent on a given screen, providing insights into user engagement and preferences.

*User Events* encompass actions like button clicks and scrolls, offering valuable data on user interactions and preferences. This information is vital for assessing user engagement patterns and optimizing the user interface for enhanced usability.

### Logging User Events (Clicks and Scrolls):

#### 1. **Click/Scroll Event Logging:**
   - For user clicks and scrolls, a dedicated `logEvent` method is employed, capturing the user's email and the specific event type (e.g., button click/scroll) along with timestamp when the event happened.
   - This logging is strategically implemented on significant buttons throughout the app to capture user interactions.

#### 2. **Scroll Event Handling within a ListView Widget:**
   - The application incorporates a `NotificationListener` wrapped around a `ListView` widget to capture scroll events initiated by the user.

#### 3. **Scroll Direction Detection:**
   - The `onNotification` callback is triggered when a `UserScrollNotification` is received, allowing for the determination of the scroll direction.
   - If the direction is forward (upward), an event with the name 'Scroll_Up_Sreen_Name' is logged.
   - If the direction is reverse (downward), an event with the name 'Scroll_Down_Sreen_Name' is logged.

#### 4. **Non-blocking Logging funtions :**
   - `logEvent` function is designed to be non-blocking to prevent slowing down the application's main thread.
   - This non-blocking approach allows the app to continue processing user interactions and UI updates without waiting for database operations to complete.  

### Screen Time Logging:

#### 1. **`logScreenTime` Method:**
   - The `logScreenTime` method is responsible for updating the usability dataset with screen time information.
   - It first queries the Firestore database to check if a document with the user's email exists.
   - If the document doesn't exist, a new document is created with user details and an initial screen time entry.
   - If the document exists, the screen time entry is added to the existing `screenTimes` array.

#### 2. **`didPush` Override:**
   - Triggered when a new screen is pushed onto the navigator.
   - Captures the start time when a screen is entered.
   - Calculates and logs screen time for the previous screen(to handle case of back-to-back pushing to the navigation stack).

#### 3. **`didPop` Override:**
   - Triggered when a screen is popped from the navigator.
   - Captures the exit time when a screen is exited.
   - Calculates and logs screen time for the popped screen.
   - Captures the start time of the screen(route) that is currently at the top of navigation stack after popping.

#### 4. **`didReplace` Override:**
   - Triggered when a new screen replaces an existing screen.
   - Captures the exit time when a screen is replaced.
   - Calculates and logs screen time for the replaced screen.
   - Captures the start time of the screen(route) that is currently at the top of navigation stack after replacing.

#### 5. **Screen Time Calculation:**
   - The duration of screen time is calculated by taking the difference between the exit and enter times.
   - If the duration is zero seconds, the logging is skipped to avoid recording insignificant screen times, possibly caused by rapid navigation changes or logging out as logout function pops out all the routes in the navigation stack.

#### 6. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The screen name includes additional information for profile screens with visited user emails if it exists to distinguish whether the user surfing his own profile or others.

#### 7. **Integration with NavigatorObservers:**
   - The `UsabilityProvider` is integrated into the Flutter application as a `NavigatorObserver`, ensuring that the defined methodologies for screen time logging are seamlessly executed throughout the app's navigation flow.

#### 8. **Non-blocking Logging funtions :**
   - `logScreenTime` function is designed to be non-blocking to prevent slowing down the application's main thread.
   - This non-blocking approach allows the app to continue processing user interactions and UI updates without waiting for database operations to complete.   

This methodology ensures accurate and detailed tracking of user interactions and screen times, providing valuable data for usability analysis within the application.
It's a common practice to avoid blocking the main thread by not awaiting certain asynchronous functions, especially if they are not critical to the immediate user experience.
